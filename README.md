- **Xcode 14.0+**
- **Swift 5.0+**

## Architecture
- iCrypto-pro follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern to keep the code clean, maintainable, and testable. The app is built with UIKit and uses view code for creating user interfaces programmatically, without Storyboards.
- Project Structure
  -	**Model:** Defines the data structures for handling cryptocurrency data.
  -	**View:** Custom views and UI elements built using UIKit and view code.
  -	**ViewModel:** Connects the View and Model, handling data transformations and API calls.

## API

- This app integrates with the CoinMarketCap API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data. To use the API, sign up for a CoinMarketCap developer account and generate an API key.

- Environment Configuration

  - API keys and other secrets are stored in environment-specific .xcconfig files for added security. The keys can be accessed in the app by using the Constants struct:
    ```swift
    struct Constants {
        static let API_KEY = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "API_KEY") as? String ?? ""
    }
    ```
## Usage
1.	Launch the app, and youâ€™ll be greeted with a search bar.
2.	Enter the name or symbol of a cryptocurrency to view details.
3.	Scroll through the list to explore other popular coins and their market information.
